This is a collection of assembly or C programs written during
the test phase of the Securitytube Linux Assembly Expert (SLAE)
course by Vivek Ramachandran.  Everyone has different ways they 
learn better and different teaching styles that they enjoy more. 
 For me, Mr. Ramachandran is great on both scores.  His course 
was very well organized, presented clearly and realistically.  
Each lesson was a single take apparently, unedited, and included 
what one might go through in the real world.  Occasionally, for 
instance, he might make a typographical error or forget a command 
line argument.  Rather than remove that bit and make it look like 
he's infallible, he would figure out what the problem was and fix 
it.  It was helpful to watch his method of work.  Rather than just 
providing full, laborious lecturing down to the lowest level of 
detail, he would demonstrate concepts, show how to watch the work 
unfold using a debugger, and provide exercises that required 
significant work on the part of the student.

For me, learning by doing is the best method.  Retention is much 
longer, and I'm forced to fit the knowledge into a frame of reference 
making things much more clear than they would be if I were spoon fed 
the finished product.  Finally, the test assignments turned out to 
be as big a learning experience as the entirety of the course.  I 
recommend this course without reservation to anyone who wants to either 
create his own shellcode, or who wants to use what is available on the 
Internet.  It's foolish to just plug in a bunch of bytecodes without 
knowing what they do.  Trust but verify.

Thank you Mr. Ramachandran, for an excellent course.
